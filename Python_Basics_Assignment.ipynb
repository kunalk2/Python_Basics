What is Python, and why is it popular?\n","\n","Ans. Python is programming langauage that is easy to understand and write, its very popular among programmers and developers .As its compatible with many platforms and it has over 1 lakh libraries and a active community of developers or programmers.It also has third party packages for various domains.\n","\n","Q2. What is an interpreter in Python ?\n","\n","Ans. An interpreter is a program that runs the written program line by line. It ranslates the high level code into machine code (binary) so the computer can understand the command and run the program.\n","\n","Q3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n","\n","Ans. Pre-defined keywords are the reserved words that have a special meaning in the python and cannot be used as names ex: for a function, variable name, etc.\n","Some examples of the python keywords are print( used to print a command like hello world or a vakue of variable , etc.), else, if, elif (these keywords are used for conditions in a program) , etc.\n","\n","Q4. Can keywords be used as variable names ?\n","\n","Ans. No keywords can't be used as variables names as keywords have a reserved words that have a specific purpose in a program even if we use the keywords as names for an variable or function and run the program the interpreter will throw an error ( i.e. its a syntax error).\n","\n","Q5. What is mutability in Python?\n","\n","Ans. By Mutability in Python we mean if we can change the content/object that has already been created. If an object can be changed then it is known as mutable (like in lists, dictionary, etc) and it the object cannot be changed then its called immutable (like tupple, strings, etc).\n","\n","Q6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n","\n","Ans.  \n","1.  Lists are mutable because it is meant to store a collection of data that might change or we want to add , delete or modify the data (like in a shopping cart of a website)\n","2.   Tuples are immutable as theyare designed for fixed values like a constant  value that needs to be fixed in a formula  or coordinates of a place that are fixed.\n","\n","Q7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n","\n","Ans. \"==\" or equality operators is used when we need to check if two objects are same or not if both are same it will say True in result otherwise it will display False.\n","While the \"is\" operator checks if two variables point to the same object in the memory or not. If variables are defined as a & b with the same content it will show false as they are different objects.\n","\n","Q8. What are logical operators in Python?\n","\n","Ans. Logical operators in Python are used on the Boolean expressions like True or False. Python has three logical operators\n","1. 'and' - If both conditions are true then returns True as result otherwise False.\n","\n","2. 'or' - If one of the condition is true then returns True as result otherwise False.\n","\n","3. 'not' - It changes the result if the condition is true and we use not it will show False as result or if condition is false and we use not the result displayed will be true.\n","\n","Q9. What is type casting in Python?\n","\n","Ans. Type casting in Python is a process to change one data type to another data type like from integer to float , from integer to string, etc.Python provides built-in functions for type casting, such as int(), float(), str(), list(), etc.\n","\n","Q10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n","Ans.\n","\n","1. Implicit Type Casting - In implicit type casting python automatically changes one data type to another like if we have a=2 and b=2.5 when we write a+b and run it we will get 4.5 so python automatically converted a from integer to a float value.\n","\n","2. Explicit Type Casting - In explicit type casting we need to manually change the data type from one to another like a=\"7\" and b=5 here 'a' is a string and 'b' is a integer so we need to change 'a' to integer or 'b' to a string to add a and b otherwise it will show an error that they are different data types.\n","\n","Q11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n","\n","Ans. Conditional statements in python are used to make a decision and it enables us to take different paths based on the conditions.Conditionals can be nested to handle multiple conditions and control different branches of execution based on the outcome of logical expressions.\n","ex: a=5 if a>5: print (\"greater than 5\") elif a==5: print (\"equal to 5\") else: print(\" less than 5\") here we used differet conditions for a & the result that will be displayed is equal to 5.\n","\n","Q12. How does the elif statement work?\n","\n","Ans. 'elif' lets us check multiple conditions after the intial 'if' statement. If the first 'if' statement is false then it will go to first 'elif' statement\n","it the condition is satistified the result will be displayed otherwise it will go the the next conditon until the condition is satified.\n","\n","Q13.What is the difference between for and while loops?\n","\n","Ans. 1. for loop - Used when we know how many times we need to repeat or used for fixed number of repeatitions or for a fixed range/collection and is used for iterating over a sequence of elements.\n","\n","2. while loop -Used when we want to run a program until the condition becomes false the run time and the repeatition can be infinite.\n","\n","Q13. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n","\n","Ans. Lets say we need to write a program to write numbers from 1 to infinity so it can be written only by the while loop as we dont know infinity. If we use for loop we need to give it a range (1 to infinity )is not possible .\n","So while loop is more suitable when we dont know how many times a condition will run than a for loop where we need a fixed range.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"7rMoritTZ5R_"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Q1.
